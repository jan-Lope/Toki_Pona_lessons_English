\subsection*{Conditional Phrases}
%
\index{\textit{la}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
With the help of the separator \textit{la} a conditional sentence is formed.
In front of the separator \textit{la} there is the conditional phrase. 
This is the condition. 
In the English language, a condition is formed using the word' if'.
In Toki Pona the separator \textit{la} serves for this purpose. 
After \textit{la} a complete main sentence begins.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Conditional phrases with a noun or pronoun}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A conditional phrase can have different structures. 
In the simplest case, a conditional phrase consists of a single word. 
This single word can only be a noun or pronoun. 
So if there is only one word slot before \textit{la} it can only be filled with a noun or pronoun. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ilo li ' pakala. && The tool is broken. \\
ken la ilo li ' pakala. && Maybe the tool is broken. \\
\end{supertabular} 

The noun \textit{ken} means 'possibility'.
\textit{ken la} therefore means 'If there is a possibility' or better 'Maybe'.
 
\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ken la jan Lisa li jo e ona. && Maybe Lisa has it. \\
ken la ona li lape. && Maybe he's alseep. \\
ken la mi ken tawa ma Elopa. && Maybe I can go to Europe. \\
\end{supertabular} 

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Composite Noun or Pronouns as Conditional Phrases}
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A conditional phrase can be also a composite noun or Pronoun. 
That is, the noun or pronoun followed by one or more adjectives or \textit{pi} phrases.
Optionally, a conjunct (\textit{anu}, \textit{en}, \textit{taso}) can be used before the noun or pronoun. 

Typical examples of this are time specifications. 
Time Specifications are formed with the noun \textit{tenpo} and adjectives. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo suno && day (sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja && night (dark time) \\
tenpo ni && the present (this time) \\
tenpo suno ni && today (this sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja ni && tonight (this dark time) \\
tenpo kama && the future (coming time) \\
tenpo kama lili && soon (little coming time) \\
tenpo pini && the past (past time) \\
tenpo suno pini && yesterday (past sun time) \\
tenpo pimeja pini && last night (past dark time) \\
tenpo suno kama && tomorrow (coming sun time) \\
tenpo mute && often (many times) \\
\end{supertabular} 

Time specifications as a conditional phrase define the time in which the statement of the main record takes place. 
Literally translated, it would mean something like this: 'If time... is, then happens...'. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo pini la mi ' weka. && In the past, I was away. \\
tenpo ni la mi lon. && At this time, I am here. \\
tenpo kama la mi lape. && In the future, I'll sleep. \\
taso tenpo pimeja pini la mi kama nasa. && But, Last night, I became drunk. \\
\end{supertabular} 

%
% Uhrzeiten, Wochentage, Monate, Jahre
%

With a question pronoun \textit{seme} in a conditional-phrase it is possible to ask for age.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo pi mute seme la sina sike e suno? && How old are you? \\
\end{supertabular} 

Birthdays come once a year, and each time you have a birthday, you have gone around the sun one complete time. 
To answer and tell someone how old you are, just replace the \textit{pi mute seme} with your age.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tenpo tu tu la mi sike e suno. && Four times (\textit{la}) I circled the sun. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Here are further examples of compound nouns or pronouns as conditional phrases. 
The first word in the conditional phrase is in each case a noun.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sama pi ni en ona la mi wile jo e ni tu. &&  If this and that is the same, I want both.\\
tawa mi la mi pilin pona. && Am I in motion, I feel good. \\
tan ni la mi sona e nasin. && If this is the cause, we know the solution. \\
lon ona la mi ken lukin e ona. && If it has suchness, we can see it. \\
\end{supertabular} 

In this example, the conditional phrase consists of a conjunction and a pronoun. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
taso ni la mi pilin pona. && Only this one makes me feel good. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Here are further examples with one noun each as a conditional phrase.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
sama la sina en mi li utala ala. && In case of equality we don't fight. \\
ante la ni li ' ike. && In case of deviations it is unfavourable.  \\
ike la sina moku e ni. && If you feel nauseous, swallow this. \\
pona la sina jo e mani. && Luckily, you have money. \\
\end{supertabular} 

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Complete Sentences as Conditional Phrases}
%
\index{if}
\index{when}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A conditional phrase can also be a complete sentence.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mama mi li ' moli la mi pilin ike. && My parents die, I feel bad. \\
mi lape la ali li ' pona. && When I'm asleep, everything is good. \\
sina moku e telo nasa la sina nasa. && If you drink beer, you'll be silly. \\
sina ' moli la sina ken ala toki. && If you are dead, you can't speak. \\
mi pali mute la mi pilin ike. && When I work a lot, I feel bad. \\
\end{supertabular} 

Commas together with the separator \textit{la} are neither necessary nor useful. 

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{The Question Pronoun \textit{seme} in a Conditional Phrase}
%
\index{seme!in conditional phrase}
\index{conditional phrase!seme}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

If the question pronoun \textit{seme} is used in a conditional-phrase, this means, 'Under what conditions is ... true?'.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
seme la telo kama, tan sewi? && Under what conditions does it rain? \\  
\end{supertabular} 

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Several Conditional Phrases in one sentence}
%
\index{\textit{la}!several}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
It is possible to use \textit{la} two times in a sentence. 
But please not more than two. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ken la tenpo pimeja la ni li ' pona. && Maybe in the night it will be ok. \\  
\end{supertabular} 

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Conditional Phrases versus Prepositional Objects after the preposition \textit{lon} }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The (compound) noun of the prepositional object after the prepostion \textit{lon} can in some cases be placed before \textit{la} with nearly the same meaning.
This only applies to location and time specifications and if the sentence contains only one predicate phrase with only one prepositional object. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi moku e telo, lon tenpo ni. && I drink now. \\
tenpo ni la mi moku e telo.  && If it's now, I'll drink. / I drink now. \\
\end{supertabular} 

The following sentence has two predicate phrases, each with a prepositional object with the preposition \textit{lon}. 
None of the prepositional objects can be moved to before the separator \textit{la} without changing the statement. 
The respective predicate phrase would be torn.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li pali, lon tomo pali li moku, lon tomo moku. && He works in the office and eats in the canteen.  \\
\end{supertabular}

If the predicate is identical for all predicate phrases, prepositional objects with \textit{lon} can be moved before \textit{la}.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li moku, lon tenpo ni li moku, lon tenpo kama. && He eats now and he eats later. \\
tenpo ni la tenpo kama la ona li moku. && Now and later he eats. \\
tenpo ni en tenpo kama la ona li moku. && Now and later he eats. \\
\end{supertabular}

The other way around it is not possible to move all possible \textit{la} phrases after the preposition \textit{lon}. 
For example, a conditional phrase before \textit{la} can consist of a complete sentence with a subject and predicate(s). 
However, you cannot use a complete sentence as a prepositional object.
In the following examples, using conditional phrases as prepositional objects with the preposition \textit{lon} would be confusing. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
lon ona la ni li ' pona, tawa mi. && If it exists, it's good for me. \\
sama ona la sina ken ante e ni. && If it's the same, you can swap it. \\
ken la mi tawa. && Maybe I'll go. \\
tawa mi la li ' pona, tawa mi.  && It's good for me when I'm on the move. \\
\end{supertabular}

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Conditional Phrases versus indirect Objects after the Intransitive Verb \textit{lon} }
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
The (compound) noun of the indirect object after the intransitive verb \textit{lon} can in some cases be placed before \textit{la} with nearly the same meaning.

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi lon tenpo ni. && I exist now. \\
tenpo ni la mi lon. && Now I exist. \\
\end{supertabular}

The following sentence has two predicate phrases, each with the intransitive verb \textit{lon}. 
Since the predicate (\textit{lon}) is the same for both predicate phrases, the indirect objects can be moved before \textit{la}. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li lon tenpo ni li lon tomo ni. && He's here during this time and in this house. \\
tenpo ni la ona li lon tomo ni.     && At this time he's in the house . \\  
tenpo ni la tomo ni la ona li lon.  && At this time and in this house he is. \\  
\end{supertabular}

The other way around it is not possible to move all possible \textit{la} phrases after the intransitive verb \textit{lon}. 
For example, a conditional phrase before \textit{la} can consist of a complete sentence with a subject and predicate(s). 
However, you cannot use a complete sentence as an indirect object.

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Conditional Phrases versus Predicate Noun \textit{lon} or Predicate Adjective \textit{lon} }
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

After the separator \textit{li} a predicate noun \textit{lon} or a predicate adjective \textit{lon} can stand also. 
Direct following words cannot be moved before \textit{lon} because they do not form an object. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
ona li ' lon ala. &&  It has no existence. \\
ona li ' lon pi nasin sewi. && It's a sacred existence. \\
\end{supertabular}

%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\subsubsection*{Conditional Phrases with Spatial Nouns}
%
\index{spatial noun!in conditional phrase}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

If a (composite) noun of a prepositional object after the preposition \textit{lon} can also be placed before \textit{la} with (almost) the same meaning, then spatial nouns can also be used in a conditional phrase. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi tawa, lon poka sina.  && I'll walk beside you. \\
poka sina la mi tawa.    && If at your side, I walk. / I'll walk beside you.  \\
\end{supertabular} 

If a (compound) noun of an indirect object after the intransitive verb \textit{lon} can also be placed before \textit{la} with (almost) the same meaning, then location-related nouns can also be used in a conditional phrase. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
tomo li lon sinpin mi.    && The house is in front of me. \\
sinpin mi la tomo li lon. && In front of me is the house. \\
\end{supertabular}

Now to use this concept in Toki Pona, you have to split your idea up into two separate sentences. 
Here's how you'd say 'Lisa is better than Susan.'

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
jan Lisa li ' pona mute. ...  && Lisa is very good. ... \\ % no-dictionary
... jan Susan li ' pona lili. && ... Susan is a little good. \\ % no-dictionary
\end{supertabular} 

Make sense? 
You say that one thing is very much of something, while you use another object as the basis for comparison and say that it's only a little bit of something. 

\begin{supertabular}{p{5,5cm}|ll}
mi ' suli mute. sina ' suli lili. && I'm bigger than you. \\
mi moku mute. sina moku lili. && I eat more than you. \\
